so right now we have to completely reintegrate with the new system handlebars
instead of sorting we will just run smart queries on the entries in the database

---Parameters---

we will have start html page with options:
-tier #: what on the list you will be bidding on just an int
-category of ad: what type of it will be(scalable to whatever) just an int
-bid: what price you want to pay for bid (float)

session parameter hopefully will be passed: 
user id: when customer logs in we will see that in session (string)
time: just use js to log time
random int for conflict

--- These parameters will be passed to the database when costumer clicks submit ---

SORTING!!

once those parameters are in the DB, we will just run a query to find each listing for each one

i know this works in SQL so i think there should be an equivalent in MongoDB

ex for sql:

for the first listing it would query for the max of tier#: that would pull up the row of all the parameters
from there it can take the ad/ ad type and whatever else is needed from database and send that to front end 
if there is a bidding conflict, then look at time submission, if submission is the same then use random int

so sorting is done though db query

conclusion/issues 

idk how mongodb queries work 
pathing needs to be learned as well
also does bidding take the ad pic? or does that come from the profile?
